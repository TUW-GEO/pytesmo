   edge cases.

v0.6.0, 2016-07-29
==================

   the same, just replace ``import pytesmo.io.sat.ascat`` by
   ``import ascat`` and everything should work the same as before.
-  The H07 reader now returns also ssm mean as a value between 0 and

v0.5.2, 2016-04-26
==================

-  Fix bugs when the validation framework encountered empty datasets for
   various reasons.
-  Add dataset adapters for masking and anomaly calculation.
-  Improve performance of moving average calculation and ISMN readers.

v0.5.1, 2016-04-21
==================

-  Fix bug in jobs argument passing to Validation class.
-  Add support to use a pre initialized DataManager instance in the
   Validation class.
-  Add support for per dataset reading method names in the DataManager.
   This relaxes the assumption that every dataset has a ``read_ts``
   method.

v0.5.0, 2016-04-20
==================

-  Fix bug in temporal resampling if input was a pandas.Series
-  Major refactoring of validation framwork. Please see updated
   documentation and example for detailed changes. The most important
   breaking changes are:
-  'type' is no longer used in the dataset dictionary.
-  the temporal matcher does no longer need to be specified since a
   reasonable default was developed that should handle most cases
-  metrics calculators are now given as dictionaries of functions.
   Please see the docs for an explanation and an example.
-  cell\_based\_jobs keyword was removed in favor of a more general
   definition of jobs.

New features are the possibility to use unrelated masking datasets and
the possibility to temporally match any number of datasets and give them
in sets of k datasets to multiple metric calculators.

-  Changes in the scaling module, escpecially CDF matching. The new CDF
   scaling module is more modular and does not make any assumptions
   about how unique the percentiles for the CDF matching have to be. CDF
   matching now returns NaN values if non unique percentiles are in the
   data. There are new functions that rescale based on pre-calculated
   percentiles so these can be used if the user wants to make sure that
   the percentiles are unique before matching.

v0.4.0, 2016-03-24
==================

-  Fix bug in validation framework due to error prone string formatting
   in warnings.

   `pygeogrids <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pygeogrids>`__ from now on.
-  Fix bug in moving average calculation when input had size 1.
-  Add recursive calculation of Pearson correlation coefficent.
-  Change H-SAF reading interface to use pygeobase consistently. This
   changes the interface slightly as the ``read_img`` method is now
   called just ``read``
-  H07 reader now returns more variables.
-  Resampling interface now respects dtype of input data.
-  Improvements in ISMN plotting interface make it possible to use the
   plot not only show it.

v0.3.6, 2015-12-10
