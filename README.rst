for new features or bug fixes.

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

- Fork the pytesmo repository to your account
- Clone the repository, make sure you use ``git clone --recursive`` to also get
  the test data repository.
- make a new feature branch from the pytesmo master branch
- hack away
- please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories
