Guidelines
----------

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

- Fork the pytesmo repository to your account
- Clone the repository, make sure you use ``git clone --recursive`` to also get
  the test data repository.
- make a new feature branch from the pytesmo master branch
- Add your feature
- please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories
  We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
- submit a pull request to our master branch

Release
-------

Windows
~~~~~~~

In order to make a working release for windows the ``whl`` files for windows
from appveyor CI have to be uploaded to PyPI. They can be found on the appveyor
CI run for the created tag under the ``jobs/Artifacts`` tab. All the ``.whl``
files should be downloaded into a folder. They can then be added to the release
on PyPI using e.g. ``twine upload pytesmo-0.7.1*whl``
