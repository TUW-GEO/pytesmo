    "# The pytesmo validation framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The pytesmo validation framework takes care of iterating over datasets, spatial and temporal matching as well as\n",
    "scaling. It uses metric calculators to then calculate metrics that are returned to the user. There are several\n",
    "metrics calculators included in pytesmo but new ones can be added simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the validation framework work? It makes these assumptions about the used datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset readers that are used have a method for reading data (usually called `read`) that can be called either by a grid point index (gpi) which can be any indicator that identifies a certain grid point or by using longitude and latitude. This means that both call signatures `read(gpi)` and `read(lon, lat)` must be valid. Please check the [pygeobase](https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pygeobase) documentation for more details on how a fully compatible dataset class should look. But a simple `read` method should do for the validation framework. This assumption can be relaxed by using the `read_ts_names` keyword in the pytesmo.validation_framework.data_manager.DataManager class.\n",
    "- **The reading method returns a pandas.DataFrame time series.**\n",
    "- Ideally the datasets classes also have a `grid` attribute that is a\n",
    "  [pygeogrids](http://pygeogrids.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) grid. This makes the calculation of lookup tables easily possible and the nearest neighbor search faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately these assumptions are true about the dataset readers included in pytesmo. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also makes a few assumptions about how to perform a validation. For a comparison study it is often necessary to\n",
    "choose a spatial reference grid, a temporal reference and a scaling or data space reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial reference\n",
    "The spatial reference is the one to which all the other datasets are matched spatially. Often through nearest\n",
    "neighbor search. The validation framework uses grid points of the dataset specified as the spatial reference to\n",
    "spatially match all the other datasets with nearest neighbor search. Other, more sophisticated spatial matching\n",
    "algorithms are not implemented at the moment. If you need a more complex spatial matching then a preprocessing of\n",
    "the data is the only option at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal reference\n",
    "The temporal reference is the dataset to which the other dataset are temporally matched. That means that the\n",
    "nearest observation to the reference timestamps in a certain time window is chosen for each comparison dataset.\n",
    "This is by default done by the temporal matching module included in pytesmo. How many datasets should be matched to\n",
    "the reference dataset at once can be configured, we will cover how to do this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data space reference\n",
    "It is often necessary to bring all the datasets into a common data space by using. Scaling is often used for that\n",
    "and pytesmo offers a choice of several scaling algorithms (e.g. CDF matching, min-max scaling, mean-std scaling,\n",
    "triple collocation based scaling). The data space reference can also be chosen independently from the other two\n",
    "references.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "After it is initialized, the validation framework works through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read all the datasets for a certain job (gpi, lon, lat)\n",
    "2. Read all the masking dataset if any\n",
    "3. Mask the temporal reference dataset using the masking data\n",
    "4. Temporally match all the chosen combinations of temporal reference and other datasets\n",
    "5. Turn the temporally matched time series over to the metric calculators\n",
    "6. Get the calculated metrics from the metric calculators\n",
    "7. Put all the metrics into a dictionary by dataset combination and return them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Masking datasets\n",
    "Masking datasets can be used if the datasets that are compared do not contain the necessary information to mask\n",
    " them. For example we might want to use modelled soil temperature data to mask our soil moisture observations\n",
    "before comparing them. To be able to do that we just need a Dataset that returns a pandas.DataFrame with one column\n",
    " of boolean data type. Everywhere where the masking dataset is `True` the data will be masked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a first example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example soil moisture validation: ASCAT - ISMN\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to setup the pytesmo validation framework to perform a comparison between ASCAT and ISMN data. \n"

In contrast to the masking adapter mentioned above, the output of the self-masking adapter is the masked data, not the the mask. The self-masking adapter wraps a data reader, which must have a `read_ts` or `read` method. Alternatively, to use a method with a name other than `read`/`read_ts`, use the `read_name` keyword which is available for each Adapter - it is still required that the method returns a pandas DataFrame! Calling the reading method will return the masked data - more precisely a DataFrame with only rows where the masking condition is true."
