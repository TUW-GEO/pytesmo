    "## Why is temporal collocation important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite observations usually have an irregular temporal sampling pattern (intervals between 6-36 hours), which is mostly controlled by the orbit of the satellite and the instrument measurement geometry. On the other hand, in-situ instruments or land surface models generally sample on regular time intervals (commonly every 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours). \n",
    "In order to compute error/performance statistics (such as RMSD, bias, correlation) between the time series coming from different sources, it is required that observation pairs (or triplets, etc.) are found which (nearly) coincide in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to identify such pairs is by using a nearest neighbor search. First, one time series needs to be selected as temporal reference (i.e. all other time series will be matched to this reference) and second, a tolerance window (typically around 1-12 hours) has to be defined characterizing the temporal correlation of neighboring observation (i.e. observations outside of the tolerance window are no longer be considered as representative neighbors).

    "## Temporal collocation in pytesmo\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytesmo contains the function `pytesmo.temporal_matching.temporal_collocation` for nearest neighbour matching. It requires a reference index (can also be a DataFrame or a Series), a DataFrame (or Series) to be collocated, and a window.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "collocated = temporal_collocation(reference, input_frame, window)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The window argument corresponds to the time intervals that are included in the nearest neighbour search in each direction, e.g. if the reference time is $t$ and the window $\\Delta$, the nearest neighbour inside $[t-\\Delta, t+\\Delta]$ is returned. If no neighbour is found `np.nan` is used as replacement. NaNs can be dropped from the returned dataframe by providing the optional keyword argument ``dropna=True`` to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are two simple examples which demonstrate the usage. The first example assumes that the index of data to be collocated is shifted by 3 hours with respect to the reference, while using a 6 hour window. The second example uses an index that is randomly shifted by $\\pm12$ hours with respect to the reference. The second example also uses a 6 hour window, which results in some missing values in the resulting dataframe."
