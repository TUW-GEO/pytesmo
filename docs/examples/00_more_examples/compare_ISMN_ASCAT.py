This example program loops through all insitu stations that measure soil moisture with a depth between 0 and 0.1m
it then finds the nearest ASCAT grid point and reads the ASCAT data. After temporal matching and scaling using linear
CDF matching it computes several metrics, like the correlation coefficients(Pearson's, Spearman's and Kendall's), Bias,
RMSD as well as the Nashâ€“Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient.
