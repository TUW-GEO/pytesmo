    Parameters
    ----------
    path : string
        path to data folder which contains the netCDF files from the FTP server
    grid_path : string
        path to grid_info folder which contains txt files with information about
        grid point index,latitude, longitude and cell

        if wetland fraction of read grid point is above this 
        threshold a warning is output during reading
    netcdftemplate : string, optional
        string template for the netCDF filename. This specifies where the cell number is
