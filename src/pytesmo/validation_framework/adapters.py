    Parameters
    ----------
     cls: object
        Reader object, has to have a `read_ts` or `read` method or a method
        name must be specified in the `read_name` kwarg. The same method will
        be available for the adapted version of the reader.
    time_offset_fields: str, list or None
        name or list of names of the fields that provide information on the time offset.
        If a list is given, all values will contribute to the offset, assuming that
        each refers to the previous. For instance:
        offset = minutes + seconds in the minute + µs in the second
        NOTE: np.nan values are counted as 0 offset
        NOTE: if None, no offset is considered
    time_units: str or list
        time units that the time_offset_fields are specified in. If a list is given,
        it should have the same size as the 'time_offset_fields' parameter
        Can be any of the np.datetime[64] units:
        https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.datetime.html
    base_time_field: str, optional. Default is None.
        If a name is provided, the generic time field will be searched for
        in the columns; otherwise, it is assumed to be the index
        NOTE: np.nan values in this field are dropped
    base_time_reference: str, optional. Default is None.
        String of format 'YYYY-mm-dd' that can be specified to tranform the
        'base_time_field' from [units since base_time_reference] to
        np.datetime[64]. If not provided, it will be assumed that the base_time_field
        is already in np.datetime[64] units
    base_time_units: str, optional. Default is "D"
        Units that the base_time_field is specified in. Only applicable with 'base_time_reference'
    replace_index: bool, optional. Default is True.
        If True, the exact timestamp is used as index. Else, it will be added
        to the dataframe on the column 'output_field'
    output_field: str, optional. Default is None.
        If a name is specified, an additional column is generated under the name,
        with the exact timestamp. Only with 'replace_index' == False
    drop_original: bool, optional. Default is True.
        Whether the base_time_field and time_offset_fields should be dropped in the
        final DataFrame
