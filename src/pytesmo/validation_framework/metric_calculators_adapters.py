            months (1-12) that belong to the group as values.

            e.g. {'Group1': [4,5,6,7,8,9], 'Group2': [10,11,12,1,2,3]} will
            split the data used by the metric calculator into 2 groups.
            One using only observations made between April and September,
            and one using observations from the rest of the year.

            The name will be used in the results to distinguish between the
            same metrics for different groups:
            e.g. ('Group1', 'BIAS'): ..., ('Group2', 'BIAS'): ..., etc. or
            'Group1|BIAS': ..., 'Group2|BIAS': ..., etc.

            all data (as the unadapted metric calculator would do):
